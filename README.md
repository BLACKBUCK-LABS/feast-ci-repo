# Feast minimal CI example

This repository demonstrates a minimal Feast CI structure
* It contains two feature repositories, one for `staging` and one for `production`
* Any changes to either the `production/` or `staging/` feature repositories will trigger a CI pipeline which will update your Feast infrastructure.
